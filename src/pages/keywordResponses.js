The process of making gundruk involves wilting the greens, then fermenting them in airtight containers for several days. The fermentation process not only preserves the greens but also enhances their flavor, resulting in a tangy and slightly sour taste. Gundruk is a popular ingredient in Nepali cuisine and is used in various dishes, such as soups, curries, and pickles. It is also known for its nutritional benefits, as the fermentation process increases the bioavailability of certain nutrients. Gundruk is a staple food in many Nepali households and is enjoyed for its unique taste and health benefits."

In the morning, make small balls or nuggets by using your hand and place them on a tray. Wet your hand often with water, which helps prevent the paste from sticking to your hand. Ensure that the balls do not touch each other.<br>5. Place the tray in direct sunlight to allow them to dry.
